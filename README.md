This is an example one-pager site that prospective job-seekers can use to quickly
highlight their accomplishments and make an introduction. It can be hosted for free using
GitHub Pages (as a Jekyll page).

This is based on a heavily pared-down version Jerome Lachaud's [Freelancer Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme).
Jerome's original theme is well-suited for designers to easily assemble a portfolio site of their visual work; this
is a prose-centric version tailored to software developers. [formspree](http://formspree.io/) is used for the contact form.
